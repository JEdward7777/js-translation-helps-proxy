        "Note": "# Introduction to John\\n\\n## Part 1: General Introduction\\n\\n### Outline of John\\n\\n1. Introduction about who Jesus is ([1:1–18](../01/01.md))\\n2. John the Baptizer baptizes Jesus, and Jesus chooses 12 disciples ([1:19–51](../01/19.md))\\n3. Jesus preaches, teaches, and heals people (2–11)\\n4. The seven days before Jesus’ death (12–19)\\n\\n  * Mary anoints the feet of Jesus ([12:1–11](../12/01.md))\\n  * Jesus rides a donkey into Jerusalem ([12:12–19](../12/12.md))\\n  * Some Greek men want to see Jesus ([12:20–36](../12/20.md))\\n  * The Jewish leaders reject Jesus ([12:37–50](../12/37.md))\\n  * Jesus teaches his disciples (13–16)\\n  * Jesus prays for himself and his disciples (17)\\n  * Jesus is arrested and undergoes trial ([18:1–19:15](../18/01.md))\\n  * Jesus is crucified and buried ([19:16–42](../19/16.md))\\n5. Jesus rises from the dead ([20:1–29](../20/01.md))\\n6. John says why he wrote his Gospel ([20:30–31](../20/30.md))\\n7. Jesus meets with the disciples (21)\\n\\nMore detailed outlines are in the introduction for each chapter.\\n\\n### What is the Gospel of John about?\\n\\nThe Gospel of John is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. These books are called “Gospels,” which means “good news.” Their authors wrote about different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. John said that he wrote his Gospel “so that people might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God” ([20:31](../20/31.md)). John’s Gospel repeatedly emphasizes that Jesus is God in human form.\\n\\nJohn’s Gospel is very different from the other three Gospels. John does not include some of the teachings and events that the other writers included in their Gospels. Also, John wrote about some teachings and events that are not in the other Gospels.\\n\\nJohn wrote much about the miraculous signs Jesus did to prove that what Jesus said about himself was true. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sign]])\\n\\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\\n\\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of John” or “The Gospel According to John.” Or they may choose a title that may be clearer, such as, “The Good News About Jesus That John Wrote.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\\n\\n### Who wrote the Gospel of John?\\n\\nThis book does not give the name of the author. However, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that the apostle John was the author. Further evidence that the apostle John wrote this Gospel is the fact that his name does not occur once within the book. Instead, this Gospel contains the phrases “the disciple whom Jesus loved” or “the other disciple” in places where the other Gospels indicate that John was present ([13:23–25](../13/23.md); [19:26–27](../19/26.md); [20:2–8](../20/02.md); [21:7](../21/07.md), [20–24](../21/20.md)). The apostle John most likely referred to himself in this manner because he wanted to humbly say that he had a very close relationship with Jesus. He was part of Jesus’ inner circle of disciples who became the “pillars” of the early church ([Galatians 2:9](../../gal/02/09.md)).\\n\\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\\n\\n### Why does John write so much about the final week of Jesus’ life?\\n\\nJohn wrote much about Jesus’ final week. He wanted his readers to think deeply about Jesus’ final week and his death on the cross. He wanted people to understand that Jesus willingly died on the cross so that God could forgive them for sinning against him. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\\n\\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\\n\\n### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?\\n\\nIn the Gospels, Jesus calls himself the “Son of Man.” This is a reference to [Daniel 7:13–14](../../dan/07/13.md). In that passage, there is a person who is described as like a “son of man.” That means that the person was someone who looked like a human being. God gave authority to this “son of man” to rule over the nations forever. All people will worship him forever.\\n\\nJews of Jesus’ time did not use “Son of Man” as a title for anyone. But Jesus used it for himself to help them understand who he truly was. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]])\\n\\nTranslating the title “Son of Man” can be difficult in many languages. Readers may misunderstand a literal translation. Translators can consider alternatives, such as “The Human One.” It may also be helpful to include a footnote to explain the title.\\n\\n### What does the word “sign” mean in the Gospel of John?\\n\\nWhile other New Testament writers use terms like “mighty works” or “wonders” to refer to the miracles that Jesus did, John prefers to use the term “sign.” The miracles John calls “signs” were significant displays of divine power. John called them signs to emphasize that an important purpose of Jesus’ miracles was to prove that Jesus was God and that what Jesus said about himself was true. John said that in his Gospel he only wrote about some of the signs that Jesus did. John said, “these have been written so that you would believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and so that believing, you would have life in his name” ([20:30–31](../20/30.md)).\\n\\n### What do the words “remain,” “reside,” and “abide” mean in the Gospel of John?\\n\\nJohn often used the words “remain,” “reside,” and “abide” as metaphors. John spoke of a believer becoming more faithful to Jesus and knowing Jesus better as if Jesus’ word “remained” in the believer. John also spoke of someone being spiritually joined to someone else as if the person “remained” in the other person. Christians are said to “remain” in Christ and in God. The Father is said to “remain” in the Son, and the Son is said to “remain” in the Father. The Son is said to “remain” in believers. The Holy Spirit is also said to “remain” in the believers.\\n\\nMany translators will find it impossible to represent these ideas in their languages in exactly the same way. For example, Jesus intended to express the idea of the Christian being spiritually together with him when he said, “He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him” ([6:56](../06/56.md)). The UST uses the idea of “will be united with me, and I will be united with them,” but translators may have to find other ways of expressing the idea.\\n\\nIn the passage, “my words remain in you” ([15:7](../15/07.md)), the UST expresses this idea as “obey what I have taught you.” Translators may find it possible to use this translation as a model.\\n\\n### What is double meaning in the Gospel of John?\\n\\nJohn occasionally used words or phrases that could have two meanings (double entendre) in the language in which he originally wrote this Gospel. For example, the phrase translated “born again” in the ULT could also mean “born from above” ([3:3](../03/03.md), [7](../03/07.md)). In such cases, you may want to choose one meaning and put the other meaning in a footnote.\\n\\n### What are the major issues in the text of the Gospel of John?\\n\\nThe following verses are found in older versions of the Bible but are not included in most modern versions. Translators are advised not to translate these verses. However, if there are older versions of the Bible in the translators’ region that include these verses, then the translators can include them. If they are translated, they should be put inside square brackets (`[ ]`) to indicate that they were probably not originally in John’s Gospel.\\n\\n  * “waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel of the Lord went down into the pool and stirred up the water at certain times, and whoever then first stepped in after the water was stirred was healed from whatever disease he suffered from.” ([5:3–4](../05/03.md))\\n  * “going through the midst of them, and so passed by” ([8:59](../08/59.md))\\n\\nThe following passage is included in most older and modern versions of the Bible. But it is not in the earliest copies of the Bible. Translators are advised to translate this passage. It should be put inside of square brackets (`[ ]`) to indicate that it may not have been original to John’s Gospel.\\n\\n  * The story of the adulterous woman ([7:53–8:11](../07/53.md)) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])"

        "Note": "# John 3 Chapter Introduction\\n\\n## Structure and Formatting\\n\\n1. Jesus teaches Nicodemus about being born again ([3:1–21](../03/01.md))\\n2. John the Baptist testifies about Jesus ([3:22–36](../03/22.md))\\n\\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\\n\\n### Light and Darkness\\n\\nThe Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, to understand what they are doing wrong, and to begin to obey God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])\\n\\n### The kingdom of God\\n\\nThe kingdom of God is a concept that is very rich in meaning. It includes the idea of eternal life in the presence of God, but it also includes the idea of what the earth will be like in the future when Jesus returns and rules everything, and the idea of life on earth right now, when and where God’s wishes are carried out fully. The unifying concept behind all of these ideas is God ruling and people embracing God’s rule over their lives. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/kingdomofgod]])\\n\\n### Born again\\n\\nA major idea in this chapter is the spiritual new birth that Jesus says is necessary in order for someone to enter the kingdom of God [3:3–8](../03/03.md). Jesus also uses the following expressions to refer to being born again: “born from water and the Spirit” ([3:4](../03/04.md)) and “born from the Spirit” ([3:6,8](../03/06.md)). (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/bornagain]])\\n\\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\\n\\n### “Son of Man”\\n\\nJesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” twice in this chapter ([3:13–14](../03/13.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. See the discussion of this concept in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])"
