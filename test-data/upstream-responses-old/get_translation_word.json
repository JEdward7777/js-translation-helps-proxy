God’s personal name is “Yahweh.” * God has always existed; he existed before anything else existed, and he will continue to exist forever. * He is the only true God and has authority over everything in the universe. * God is perfectly righteous, infinitely wise, holy, sinless, just, merciful, and loving. * He is a covenant-keeping God, who always fulfills his promises. * People were created to worship God and he is the only one they should worship. * God revealed his name as “Yahweh,” which means “he is” or “I am” or “the One who (always) exists.” * The Bible also teaches about false “gods,” which are nonliving idols that people wrongly worship.",

        "definition": "To love another person is to care for that person and do things that will benefit him. There are different meanings for “love” some languages may express using different words: 1. The kind of love that comes from God is focused on the good of others even when it does not benefit oneself. This kind of love cares for others, no matter what they do. God himself is love and is the source of true love. * Jesus showed this kind of love by sacrificing his life in order to rescue us from sin and death. He also taught his followers to love others sacrificially. * When people love others with this kind of love, they act in ways that show they are thinking of what will cause the others to thrive. This kind of love especially includes forgiving others. * In the ULT, the word “love” refers to this kind of sacrificial love, unless a Translation Note indicates a different meaning. 2. Another word in the New Testament refers to brotherly love, or love for a friend or family member. * This term refers to natural human love between friends or relatives. * The term can also be used in such contexts as, “They love to sit in the most important seats at a banquet.” This means that they “like very much” or “greatly desire” to do that. 3. The word “love” can also refer to romantic love between a man and a woman.",

Sin can also refer to not doing something that God wants us to do. * Sin includes anything we do that does not obey or please God, even things that other people do not know about. * Thoughts and actions that disobey God’s will are called “sinful.” * Because Adam sinned, all human beings are born with a “sinful nature,” a nature that that controls them and causes them to sin. * A “sinner” is someone who sins, so every human being is a sinner. * Sometimes the word “sinners” was used by religious people like the Pharisees to refer to people who did not keep the law as well as the Pharisees thought they should. * The term “sinner” was also used for people who were considered to be worse sinners than other people. For example, this label was given to tax collectors and prostitutes.",
